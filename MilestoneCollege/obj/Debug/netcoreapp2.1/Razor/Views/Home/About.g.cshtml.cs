Among us, some have worked and are still working in universities and the others have worked at renowned colleges and cadet colleges as professors &amp; principals. In the light of our long experience, we have perceived that our children, despite securing good results and being meritorious, cannot attain the expected resu");

Moreover, having completed their education in Bangla Medium, most of these students remain weak in writing and speaking in English. As a result, when they go abroad for higher studies, they fall in deep water. Even in our own country, they fail to get a good job in the multinational companies.</p>

This is mainly due to the British curriculum followed at ‘O’ &amp; ‘A’ level Exams. Where our students are taught British culture, heritage &amp; tradition.

		<p style=""text-align:justify"">Against this backdrop of confusion and disorder in the education system of the country, we ventured to establish an ideal educational institution in the year 2001 named Milestone College at Gareeb-e-Newaz Avenue, Sector 11 of Uttara Model Town, Uttara, Dhaka 1230. The building where we started is owned by Milestone family and now it is used as the Headquarters of Milestone.</p>
